Even as we get ever closer to CDI 2.0 final version, we shan't forget about our stable 2.4 branch.
Ladies and gentlemen, here comes the next-in-line 2.4 release - Weld 2.4.3.Final!

Notable fixes and improvements:

* Weld now shares proxy classes for built-in beans of the same type (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2344[WELD-2344, window="_blank"])
* Fixed usage of Jandex on Tomcat when using `unpackWars=false` (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2357[WELD-2357, window="_blank"])
* Weld now supports wider variety of non-portable extension observer methods (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2338[WELD-2338, window="_blank"])
* There is now new debug level logging during bootstrap which allows to monitor name, start, end and duration of all bootstrap phases (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2336[WELD-2336, window="_blank"])
* Session replication
** Built-in session and conversation scoped beans are not part of the bean identifier index anymore (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2343[WELD-2343, window="_blank"])
** Handle situation when `HTTPSessionBean` might not be serializable (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2346[WELD-2346, window="_blank"]) 
* Weld SE
** You can now easily register new `org.jboss.weld.bootstrap.api.Service` during container bootstrap (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2360[WELD-2360, window="_blank"])
** Any `javax.enterprise.inject.spi.CDI` method can now be called during `AfterDeploymentValidation` (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2371[WELD-2371, window="_blank"])
** `ContainerInitialized` event is now correctly fired after registration of shutdown hook (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2340[WELD-2340, window="_blank"])
** `ContainerInitialized` and `ContainerShutdown` now implement `toString()` (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2354[WELD-2354, window="_blank"])
* Probe development tool
** Allow monitoring of bean instance creation using `AroundConstruct` (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2332[WELD-2332, window="_blank"])
** Fixed a situation when bean was wrongly marked as unused when injected as parameter (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2342[WELD-2342, window="_blank"])
